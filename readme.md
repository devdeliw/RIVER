# RIVER 

**R**ust **I**nfrastructure for **V**ector and **E**igenvalue **R**outines. 

A clean and optimized numerical computing library written in Rust.  

Still in development. Currently I am writing [CORAL](https://github.com/devdeliw/CORAL), a
pure-RUST implementation of BLAS. River will wrap around it for LAPACK/other
Numerical computing routines.
